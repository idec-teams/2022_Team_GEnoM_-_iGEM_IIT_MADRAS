Cancer is amongst the largest killers in the world, with over 9.9 million people succumbing to its throes in the year 2021. The most widely accepted treatment for this is chemotherapy, which can pose deleterious effects to not only malignant, but also healthy cells of the body, along with reduction of the immune response due to its non-specificity and low efficacy. There is an immediate need to introduce targeted therapeutic drugs in order to combat more aggressive cancers. Realizing this tremendous potential for improved forms of targeted cancer therapy, our team resolved to work on a potential cancer therapy involving therapeutic drugs in the form of enzyme-prodrug therapy. Source: IHME, Global Burden of Disease (2019) About cytosine deaminase and its enzymatic function The enzyme cytosine deaminase is found in several prokaryotes and a few eukaryotes. Our project adopts the deamination of 5-fluorocytosine (5FC) as the inactive drug into the active 5- fluorouracil (5FU) by employing yeast cytosine deaminase (yCD). 5FU is an antimetabolite interfering with the synthesis of thymine by altering the shape of thymidylate synthase, causing errors in DNA replication and preventing tumor cell proliferation. Targeted delivery of this prodrug to the tumor regions can lead to apoptosis of the cells to produce anti-cancer effects. The direct administration of 5FU may induce several side effects such as increased risk of getting infections, bleeding, and breathlessness. Since 5FC is not deaminated in mammalian cells and is well absorbed, 5FC and CD delivery has little intrinsic toxicity and poses several advantages over direct 5FU delivery.

Owing to the low pH conditions found in microtumor environments, the wild type enzyme needs to be mutated to stably function under slightly acidic conditions. Thus, we aim to engineer mutant CD strains with improved stability in the acidic pH range resembling the microtumor environment. We have chosen cytosine deaminase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yCD) for optimization over its bacterial counterpart (bCD) due to its improved efficacy and sensitivity towards 5-FC.

RSC Advances. 8. 22182-22192. 10.1039/C8RA02095G What is directed evolution? Directed evolution is a method which aims to mimic the process of natural selection to attain a specific predefined-goal. Mutations are induced in a given protein and nucleic acid, followed by assaying proteins and selecting the best mutant for the required function. This requires the structure of the protein to be studied in detail, in order to better understand the regions to be mutated. The broad steps involved in performing directed evolution are the generation of multiple mutant libraries, followed by screening for the best mutants. A superior mutant may be produced from the best mutants through genetic recombination. Owing to the refinements and advancements that directed evolution has brought to the field of synthetic biology, our team concluded that it was the best method to facilitate achieving our goal of creating a pH-stable mutant of cytosine deaminase.

A structure based statistical mechanical model is then employed to predict the thermal stability of the mutants. The server gives a stability-sorted list of the top 5000 mutants ordered based on their net electrostatic interaction energies and locations of mutational hotspots. propKa: propKa web server provides an empirical method to predict the variation of pKa values of protein\u2019s side chains based on the position of the group and chemical interactions with other groups in its vicinity. Using the tool, Intra-protein electrostatic interactions of the amino acid residues at the active site of the target enzyme was identified. Any mutation affecting amino acid residues interacting with the active site amino acid residues was avoided. pyMOL: pyMOL is a powerful molecular simulation software to visualize the three dimensional structure of proteins and other macromolecules. pyMOL was used to generate the PDB files of stable mutant enzymes identified from the pStab server. The PDB of the mutant molecule was uploaded to pSTAB and the electrostatic energy of the triple mutants were obtained to analyze their stability.

This requires the structure of the protein to be studied in detail, in order to better understand the regions to be mutated. The broad steps involved in performing directed evolution are the generation of multiple mutant libraries, followed by screening for the best mutants. A superior mutant may be produced from the best mutants through genetic recombination. Owing to the refinements and advancements that directed evolution has brought to the field of synthetic biology, our team concluded that it was the best method to facilitate achieving our goal of creating a pH-stable mutant of cytosine deaminase.

Its protein structure consists of a central 5-stranded\u03b2-sheet (\u03b21 - \u03b25), with the strand order 2, 1, 3, 4, 5. \u03b21 runs antiparallel to the other strands. This sheet is sandwiched by -helices, with two (\u03b1A, \u03b1E) on one side and three (\u03b1B Figure 5 - \u03b1D) on the other side. It forms a tightly packed dimer in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, with subunits without considerable differences. There are 18 direct hydrogen bonds across the dimer interface. The center of the dimer contains two hydrophobic patches formed by Met93, Ala97, and Met100 and a buried water molecule surrounded by Thr60, Ile65, and Met93. The chains of Tyr121 enclose four water molecules in a cavity between \u03b1C and \u03b1D, flanked by two salt bridges between Asp92 and Arg125 [15]. The active site contains one tightly bound metal ion, identified as zinc based on anomalous data. The zinc ion exhibits tetrahedral coordination with Cys91, Cys94, His62, and the hydroxyl group of the bound inhibitor 3,4-dihydrouracil (DHU) [16]. The protein ligands are present on the N termini of the \u03b1B and \u03b1C helices. The inhibitor 2-hydroxypyrimidine is embedded in the active site in its hydrated form. The inhibitor\u2019s OH4 group directly coordinates with the zinc ion and interacts with Glu64 and Cys91. The N3 atom interacts with Glu64, the O2 atom forms hydrogen bonds with Gly63 and Asn51, and the N1 atom exhibits interactions with Asp155. As a result, yCD converts hydroxypyrimidine into 4-(R)-hydroxyl-3,4-dihydropyrimidine. Reaction Mechanism The yeast cytosine deaminase protein uses zinc in its catalytic binding domain. It is likely to undergo a concerted reaction, with zinc being ligated in a distorted tetrahedral form, with zinc\u2019s filled d orbitals allowing it to change from a 4 ligand form to a 5 ligand form with no loss in energy. We also hypothesize that the pH activity change may impact the structure of the zinc integration in the protein due to differing availability of H+ ions at different pH values. This would change the ligation number of zinc, and possibly the structure at the active site. At pH 5 the concentration of hydrogen ions is high. These hydrogen ions attack the oxygen marked as 1 a higher concentration than at pH 7. Once the hydrogen ions in the medium forms a bond with the oxygen, it inhibits the formation of hydrogen bond with cytosine. Hence, hydrogen ions inhibit the deamination of cytosine. The uracil production, thus comes down when the pH is decreased. This reaction hindered by the hydrogen ions is depicted in Figure 5. pH Stability The stability of various mutants of yCD at pH 5 is studied using pSTAB, a software used to engineer protein stabilities. The wild type yCD enzyme is more stable at pH 5 than at pH 7. However, we have tried to improve the stability of yCD at pH 5 by inducing various mutations. The pSTAB program suggested a list of residues which are hotspots for improving the stability of cytosine deaminase.

Various amino acids have been substituted at these positions and the corresponding \u2206E values are mentioned in Table 2. Also, pSTAB suggests that the mutations made at the 92nd, 110th, 117th and 125th positions must be neutral.

Thus, alanine was substituted in the 80th position, arginine in the 110th position and aspartic acid in the 120th position as shown in Figure 7.F. Inferences From these results it can be seen that certain mutations have the possibility of increasing stability. While stability and activity cannot be directly correlated, it can be seen that there is some correlation. Site-specific mutagenesis can help mutate specific residues in order to increase stability in the enzyme. However random mutagenesis may also be of use considering that modeling cannot cover all possible scenarios, allowing us to look at mutations or combinations of mutations that we may not have considered. As mentioned above, stability and activity cannot be directly correlated as enzymes that are more stable in certain conditions may have sufficient rigidity to lower their activity levels. This results in increasing stability which may seemingly increase activity or reduce activity. The software used for modeling has asparagine and glutamine modified to change electrostatic considerations in order to simulate mutations. While this has useful limitations in the sense that it can only predict what is the necessary charge on the mutated residues to increase stability this leaves other considerations such as size and hydrophobic interactions to take into account in order to accurately simulate mutation models. These considerations can be reduced by conducting wet lab-based tests like conducting site specific mutagenesis repeatedly and then conducting enzymatic activity assays in order to assess final turnover number. Additionally, the electrostatic stability predicted by the software cannot necessarily be correlated with stability for reasons previously mentioned, and also limitations inherent to the software. Our way Forward Our current primary focus is the wet lab implementation of this project. Some aspects of our project have been challenging to model computationally, such as functional testing and activity analysis. Due to the dynamic behaviour of the protein and the constant perturbations resulting from the interactions between the amino acids and the environment, these aspects are more reliably and effectively studied through wet lab experimentation. Apart from performing experimental protocols, we also aim to work on site-specific drug delivery. Several drug delivery methods are currently utilised for similar purposes, such as prodrug formation, encapsulins, time-dependent self-assembling delivery systems, and biodegradable polymers. One of the methods we are researching is the utilisation of encapsulins for drug delivery. Encapsulins are protein cages having multiple nanocompartments. The surface of these encapsulins can have chromophore probes which can be utilised to identify and locate target molecules. We want to analyse these methods in detail and select a strategy best suited for our project requirements as it has potential in terms of cancer therapy.
