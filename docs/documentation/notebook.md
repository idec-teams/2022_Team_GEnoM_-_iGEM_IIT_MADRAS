 Date   | Task performed   | 
| ------ | ---------- | 
| 8th June, 2022 | 12 new lab members were inducted into the iGEM IITM Team | 
| 14th June | "First lab team meet New members were briefed about directed evolution and iDEC" | 
| 15th June | Work was initiated to ideate on a project for iDEC. One avenue was to integrate directed evolution with an ongoing project on bacterial cellulose. The other avenue was to come with a new project entirely. |
 16th June |Resources regarding directed evolution and iDEC were shared with the team  | 
| 21st June | "Review Meet – 1 Ideas for projects were presented by lab members and discussed" |
| 25th June | "Review Meet – 2 Members presented their final project ideas" |
| 27th June | "Faculty Advisor Meet We presented a set of ideas for the competition and our advisor critically assessed them, helping us choose the idea for our final abstract and detail it." | 
 28th June |"Review Meet - 3 Discussed Faculty Advisor’s feedback with team members and solidified our project idea with slight modifications"   | 
| 29th June | "Project Abstract Meet Divided work amongst ourselves to cover various sections of the project abstract required for the submission" | 
| 30th June | Finalization of Project Abstract | 
| 1st July| Team Meet - Submission of project abstract | 
| July Week-2| "Team Meet Coming up with a convenient team structure to enable different sub-groups working on different verticals under the project" |
 14th July | Discussed project experimental design with sub-groups designated to work on different steps of the experimental design | 
| 18th July | "Updates Meet Brief updates regarding research on topics under experimental design" |
| 21st July | Detailed updates regarding experimental design including working with yeast, mutagenesis/mutant library generation, recombination techniques to form varied mutant library, yeast cloning, screening of mutants, making cells stable in hypoxic regions and unstable in other regions | 
| July Week-4 | Start of new semester - break | 
| 5th - 6th Aug | "Wet Lab Intro session for new team members Cultured and plated bacteria" |
|8th Aug | Further Literature Review and obtaining protocols for the experimental design from isolation of gene to methods of mutagenesis like ePCR, discussion on using E.coli as expression system for yCD |
| 8th August | Initial efforts were made to decide on possible computational methods that can be used to enhance the project. This mainly involved literature review. |
| 9th August | An overview report on already available computational tools for directed evolution was presented. This included tools like SCHEMA, MAP, HotSpot Wizard, PEDEL and B-FITTER |
| 19th August | The tools discussed earlier were explored further. HotSpot Wizard was run using default parameters to get a general idea on the mutational hotspots present in yeast cytosine deaminase. |
